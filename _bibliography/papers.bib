  abstract={What would happen if the homicide rate in the most violent country in the world suddenly decreases? In this paper, we study how a truce between the major gangs in El Salvador affected firms' behavior. By combining administrative data with a novel firms' victimization survey, we find negative effects of the pact on firms' size. The average firm reduced their number of employees by 2\%, with the impact concentrated in micro and medium firms. We argue that the truce increased the expected punishment, that gangs can impose on companies, more than the benefits generated from the violence reduction. Thus, affecting negatively firms.},

  title={Climate Change and Female Targeted Conflict},
  author={Anderson, Siwan and Jaramillo, Daniel},

  abstract={This paper tests for whether climate change threatens to intensify gender based violence by armed  political actors. To causally identify the effects, we focus on geo-located panel data for Africa. Our outcomes of focus encompass direct killings, forced kidnappings, torture, and sexual violence. We find evidence that negative climate shocks exacerbate these measures of female targeted civilian conflict. Our results do not seem to support an opportunity cost explanation for violence on behalf of male perpetrators. Instead they appear most consistent with a behavioural response when negative climate shocks induce heightened aggressive reactions towards females. Indicators of societal female empowerment tend to mitigate this extreme gender based violence exacerbated by climate change. In line with the notion that armed male actors engage in even more gender based violence (induced by increased climate stress and vulnerability) in societies with gender biased views and norms.},
