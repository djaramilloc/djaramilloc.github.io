  abstract={What would happen if the homicide rate in the most violent country in the
    world suddenly decreases? In this paper, we study how a truce between the
    major gangs in El Salvador affected firms' behavior. By combining
    administrative data with a novel firms' victimization survey, we find
    negative effects of the pact on firms' size. The average firm reduced their
    number of employees by 2\%, with the impact concentrated in micro and medium
    firms. We argue that the truce increased the expected punishment, that gangs
    can impose on companies, more than the benefits generated from the violence
    reduction. Thus, affecting negatively firms.},
