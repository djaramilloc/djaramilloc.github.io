  abstract={Can a decline in violence hinder economic activity? We combined administrative data and a novel victimization survey to evaluate the effects of a truce between the major gangs in El Salvador on firms' behavior. Using firms' exposure to gang activity, we found that firms more exposed to the truce reduced their number of employees by 2%, with the impact concentrated in micro and medium-sized firms. We did not find any effects on entry and exit. We argue that the truce increased gangs' expected punishment more than the benefits generated from the reduction in violence..},

  title={Climate Change and Female Targeted Conflict},

  abstract={This paper tests whether climate change threatens to intensify gender-based violence by armed political actors. To causally identify the effects, we focus on geo-located panel data for Africa. Our outcomes of focus encompass direct killings, forced kidnappings, torture, and sexual violence. We find evidence that negative climate shocks exacerbate these measures of female-targeted civilian conflict. Our results do not seem to support an opportunity cost explanation for violence on behalf of male perpetrators. Instead, they appear most consistent with a behavioral response when negative climate shocks induce heightened aggressive reactions towards females. Indicators of societal female empowerment tend to mitigate this extreme gender-based violence exacerbated by climate change. This is in line with the notion that armed male actors engage in even more gender-based violence (induced by increased climate stress and vulnerability) in societies with gender-biased views and norms.},
