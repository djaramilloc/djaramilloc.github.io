  abstract={Do released offenders influence the criminal behavior of individuals in the neighborhoods they rejoin? Using a novel dataset containing comprehensive information on arrests, prison releases, and places of residence for the universe of men in Ecuador and employing a difference-in-difference design, I find evidence that released offenders contribute to increased criminal activity among their neighbors. On average, one additional release per 1,000 residents leads to an increase of 0.73 arrests, excluding recidivism. First-time offenders account for 47% of this effect, with the primary mechanism being the spread of criminal behavior through peer and family networks. These peer effects are larger for defendants who served longer portions of their sentences, suggesting that time spent in prison may intensify criminal behavior. Finally, I show that access to job training programs during incarceration can mitigate these effects.},
