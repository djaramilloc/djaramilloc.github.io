  abstract={This paper examines whether recently released offenders influence the criminal behavior of individuals in the neighborhoods they rejoin. Using a novel dataset containing comprehensive data on arrests, prison releases, and residences for the universe of men in Ecuador and employing a difference-in-difference design around a mass pardon, I find evidence of criminogenic effects from releasees on their neighbors. Specifically, I estimate a monthly release-to-arrest elasticity of 0.23. To explain this result, I provide evidence of a direct criminal contagion mechanism among peers, particularly family members. These peer effects extend to both individuals with and without prior criminal experience. The findings suggest a detrimental impact of offender reentry, highlighting the importance of peer interactions in the spread of criminal behavior.},
