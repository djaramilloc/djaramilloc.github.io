I am PhD candidate in Economics at [The University of British Columbia](https://economics.ubc.ca/). My research interests are development economics, with a focus on crime and conflict.

Previously to starting my PhD I worked as a Research Fellow at the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en), and obtained my MA in Economics from [UBC](https://economics.ubc.ca/).

You can find my CV <a href="/assets/pdf/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
