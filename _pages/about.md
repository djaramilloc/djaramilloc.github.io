I am an Economist working at the Citizen Security Division of the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en). My research focuses on economic development, public, and labor economics. In particular, I study the causes and consequences of crime and conflict in developing countries.

I obtained my Ph.D. in economics from [The University of British Columbia](https://economics.ubc.ca/) in 2025.
