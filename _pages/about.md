I am an Economist working at the Citizen Security Division of the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en). My research explores questions at the intersection of economic development and labor economics, with a particular focus on the causes and consequences of crime and conflict in developing countries.

In addition, I serve as a Teaching Fellow in the Master’s program in Econometrics at the [Universidad de la Américas](https://sitios.udla.edu.ec/econometria/).

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from [The University of British Columbia](https://economics.ubc.ca/) in 2025, where I also completed my M.A. in Economics. I hold a B.A. in Economics from the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador.
