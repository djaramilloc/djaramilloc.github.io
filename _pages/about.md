I am Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [The University of British Columbia](https://economics.ubc.ca/). I am an applied microeconomics, with  interests in economic development, political economy, and public economics. In particular, I study the causes and consequences of crime and conflict in developing countries.

Previously to starting my PhD I worked as a Research Fellow at the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en), and obtained my MA in Economics from [UBC](https://economics.ubc.ca/).

**I am in the 2024/2025 Economics Job Market.**
